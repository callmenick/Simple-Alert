# Simple Alert

A JavaScript component that displays alerts to the user. Alerts may be either of 4 types:

* error
* success
* warning
* default

This is a very basic demo, and mainly serves as an introduction to building your own JavaScript component with object oriented style programming. This component can however be used in any project, and extended/modified at your own will.
